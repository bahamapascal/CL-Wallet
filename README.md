# CL-Wallet

### Description
A python based command line Wallet for IOTA.

Special features:
 - Addresses don't need to be attached to the tangle
 - Immune to snapshots as all necessary data is saved in a local file
 - Can send multiple transfers in one bundle
 
Please note that this is is still in Alpha stages and as such not all functionality is integrated yet.


### Usage:

You need:
 - Python 2.7 (not compatible yet with python 3) 
 - and the PyOTA library `pip install pyota`

On windows you can just use the "Start CL Wallet.bat". On any other OS you need to open "Wallet.py" via command line.
Important: If you start via command line, make sure to use a console that has a width of 140 columns.
